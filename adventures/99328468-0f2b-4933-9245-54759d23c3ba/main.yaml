  Good job getting to this point.  We're awfully proud of you!
  <pause>
  Now that you're ready, your journey begins in the town of Seringia, where your party has assembled.  After a few minutes of, at times, heated debate, %lead_hero.name is deemed as the best fit to be your party's leader.

  Having settled that little dispute, %random_hero produces a faded map, showing the approximate location of the Dzerritain Tavern, located on the periphery of the Dzerritain mountains, the best lead you have for finding an abundance of wealth, in addition to the opportunity to increase your fame across all the lands.

# List of rooms/spaces in the adventure scenario
rooms:
  - name: Dzerritain Tavern
    description: |
      Your party has reached Dzerritain Tavern, a real hole-in-the-wall, tucked into the foot of Dzerritain's infamous, deadly mountain range.  Upon entry, it is immediately apparent, and suspicious, that there are almost no other travelers in the main room.  Solely an aging, hefty dwarf sleeps in his chair, snoring loudly, as he leans against a wall, just adjacent to a blazing fireplace.  As there are no observable proprietors, nor guests to interrogate, %lead_hero.name saunters over, clearly making enough noise on her way, to wake the sleeping dwarf.  When she reaches the still-sleeping patron, she extends an arm to poke him in the shoulder, beginning to speak, "Hey! we're looking for...".  But before she makes contact, a lightning-quick grab, followed by an even faster leg-sweep, finds %lead_hero.name on the groud, staring at the ceiling.  %random_hero.name begins to snicker, but her chuckle is cut short, as another blurred movement from the dwarf results in %random_hero.name pinned through her loincloth, into the wall behind her, by an evil-looking throwing knife.  "Oh fff..." she mumbles as she unsuccessfully attempts to detach from both wall and blade.  Well, this situation got nasty quickly, now didn't it...

    # Portals defines connections to other rooms in the scenario
    portals:
      - name: Hidden Corridor
        event:
          death_chance: 0%
          portal_breaks: 100
          text: As the final hero exits the corridor, she pats the wall.  Immediately, a horrible crack is heard, followed by an avalanche of dirt, rocks and debris filling the corridor behind her.  Nice job...  Hopefully there is another exit!

      - name: Rickety Ladder
        event:
          # One time use.  After that, the portal is removed
          # from this room and players will no longer be able
          # to go this way.
          portal_breaks: 100
          text: The ladder breaks as the last party member descends.
            You aren't going back up that way!
