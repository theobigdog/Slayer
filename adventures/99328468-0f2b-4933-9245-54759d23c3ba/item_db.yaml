# "static field": data field loaded from a yaml file that an
#                 item, room, mob, etc starts with
#
# "dynamic field": data that is applied while running

# Example: when an item is looted, a new field is applied that
#          names the mob or room that yielded the item.

# By default, all items are equipable
# By default, hit_modifier = 100%
# By default, all special items are rechargeable (can be used again in a subsequent encounter)
# By default, no items are enchanted
# By default, all items are destroyed when durability runs out
# No class-restrictions if category not mentioned

# Dice: Must be 4-sided, 6-sided, 8-sided, 10-sided, 12-sided, or 20-sided only

'''
"Damage Roll" lingo examples:
1) "3d6" = 3 x six-sided "d"ice rolls, added together
2) "2d8 + 10" = 2 x eight-sided dice rolls, plus 10
3) "3d10kh2*2" = 3 x ten-sided dice rolls, but "k"eep only the "h"ighest 2 values, then multiply entire thing by 2
4) "5d20pl2e<5" = 5 x twenty-sided dice rolls, but dro"p" the "l"owest 2 rolls, and for "e"ach roll less than 5, add another roll (keeping the original roll(s) < 5)
5) "(4d12ra1)//2" = 4 x twelve-sided dice rolls, "r"eroll and "a"dd a die (once!, and only one die, even if multiple match the subsequent given value) if it has a value of 1,
      then divide(//, rounded to nearest integer) the entire thing("()") by 2
6) "4d20ro1mi5 + 3d20ma15" = 4 x twenty-sided dice rolls, reroll "o"nce any(1) die with a value of 1, and all rolls (for this half of the equation only) are a "mi"nimum of 5 (anything lower is rounded up to 5),
      then add 3 x twenty-sided dice rolls, all with a "ma"ximum of 15 (anything higher is rounded down to 15)
7) "(2d8kh1, 7, 3d6kl2)kh1" = keep the highest 1 of:
      A) 2 x eight-sided dice rolls, keeping only the highest 1
      B) 7
      C) 3 x six-sided dice rolls, keeping the lowest 2 only
